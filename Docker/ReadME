To run the dashboard. Make sure containers are up and runing.
in mongo_read.py make sure that your url to acces the database matches the name of the container created and the ports for it.
client = MongoClient('mongodb://<containerName>:27017')
example
client = MongoClient('mongodb://AMDcontainer2:27017')
In app.py make sure this line is correct acording to your particular network setup
app.run_server(debug=True, port=8080, host="0.0.0.0")
port should be the one delcared for dash in the .yml file
